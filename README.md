Practice data science projects from: https://www.datacamp.com/projects:

+ **Dr. Semmelweis and the Discovery of Hand Washing**
In 1847, contaminated hands were a major cause of childbed fever. Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis saved hundreds of lives by enforcing handwashing at his hospital. Python project renalyzing the medical data Semmelweis collected. ***Pandas Dataframes, Matplotlib, bootstrap statistical analysis.*** https://projects.datacamp.com/projects/20

+**Recreating John Snow's Ghost Map**
In 1854, Dr. John Snow (no, not the Game of Thrones's character) used a pre-computer method of spatial analysis by mapping patterns and occurrences of cholera outbreaks in Soho, London. He mapped the deaths in the neighbourhood and determined that a vast majority occurred around one particular water well and that those that died used that well. It is not only one of the earliest uses of data visualization, but by solving this problem, he also founded spatial analysis and modern epidemiology. **Pandas, Dataframes, Folium, Leaflet, Bokeh*** https://projects.datacamp.com/projects/132
